    <div class="bordered_box"><br>
        <p>novos is my ongoing toy operating system project, written in C++ and assembly. my end goal is to turn it into the sort of sci-fi stuff you'd see on the monitor of the computer system in a retro-futuristic spaceship in your average Alien film, or as the main game view in a game like <a href="https://oolite.space">Oolite</a>. so <b>this project is a sort of videogame/art project, but completely bootable</b> with all my own libraries!</p>
        <br>
        <p>it's difficult to really show off what i've been doing with this project, since most of the achievements i've made are technical milestones which seem extremely mundane from a perspective of the user-space we're all used to when using computers, but a few of the key milestones i've reached so far:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>from-scratch bootloader, capable of loading into 32-bit mode and unpacking an ELF executable, written in assembly</li>
            <li>memory management, dynamic memory allocation (no pages yet)</li>
            <li>screen output and structured UI tree</li>
            <li>strings, dynamic arrays, linked-lists, and other fundamental data structures</li>
            <li>IDT control in C++ land, interrupt handling, interrupt remapping</li>
            <li>GDT control/configuration in C++ land</li>
            <li>fully functional keyboard driver supporting scan code set 2, interrupt driven</li>
            <li>text rendering using a simple custom bitmap font</li>
            <li>resource embedding as raw binary data, images and 3D models readable within the OS after boot</li>
            <li>full matrix and vector math library, enabling wireframe rendering of 3D models at a reasonable 50fps on a single CPU thread</li>
        </ul>
        <p>it's come a long way, but there's still a long way to go. my next move (as of writing this) is implementing timer support using either APIC or PIC, which will enable multithreading, and starting work on file-system parsing to break up the OS from being one big binary file.</p>
