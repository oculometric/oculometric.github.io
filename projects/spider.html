        <p>this project was a study in hard-surface modelling, rigging, and animation. after some very basic sketches i moved into Blender to model this eight-legged friend. 4 joints per leg, and a movable eye/camera unit in the center of its body, it's fully rigged with inverse kinematics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>its materials are procedural using Blender's shader nodes, combined with weight painting to be rustier in certain places (around joints).</p>

    <div class="bordered_box"><br>
        <p>i animated a looping walk cycle (or more like a scuttling cycle) for the spider, though i never got around to animating any other actions</p>
        <br>
        <p>i originally made this for an Unreal project (which didn't get very far) where you would control two different spiders and switch between their body-camera-eyes to navigate them around a room and solve spatial puzzles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>the model totals 20k tris, which is a fair few, but i made an effort to keep it minimal (especially with all the small joints and details)</p>
