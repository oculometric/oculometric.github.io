        <p>in July 2023, i was contacted by the publicity team at Movement Detroit, an annual music festival in Detroit, to create a promotional video for the next festival.</p>
        <br>
        <p>i worked closely with my contact at Movement Detroit to iterate on and improve the result, incorporating lots of feedback.</p>
        <br>
        <p>through the course of the project, i learned Davinci Resolve for editing from scratch, i got to exercise my hard-surface modelling skills, and i had fun creating retro wireframe visuals for various different elements.</p>
        <p>there were quite a few pieces of 3D work that were cut in the final edit but it was all good practice.</p>

        <p>there were quite a few pieces of 3D work that were cut in the final edit but it was all good practice.</p>
        <br>
        <p>overall this was a really interesting challenge, not just having to work for a client, but also integrating clips of 3D work with provided clips from the previous festival.</p>
        <br>
        <p>a few months after i handed in the final edit, my contact at Movement let me know that they did end up swapping a few of the clips from previous festivals out.</p>
