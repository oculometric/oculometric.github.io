        <p>this is a digital artwork i created using Blender for an open call for submissions held by Tate Collective in August 2022, on a brief of 'Cyborg Futures'.</p>
        <br>
        <p>my piece was selected to be exhibited in the Tate Britain in London alongside around 80 others.</p>
        <br>
        <p>i created every part of the work from scratch, including modelling and rigging the robotic arm, designing the materials, and developing a complex compositing process to produce the stylised 'graphite' overall look. you can see more about my graphite style projects <a href="https://oculometric.artstation.com/albums/7363541">here</a>.</p>

        <p>this piece was my submission for another open call held by Tate Collective, this one in November 2022, celebrating the work of Paul Cezanne.</p>
        <br>
        <p>it was selected along with just 9 others to be exhibited in the Tate Modern in London.</p>
        <br>
        <p>the character shown in the bottom left was something i challenged myself to model and rig for a previous project. the apples in the well in the center were placed with a combination of physics simulation and manual manipulation. the materials on the walls, apples, floor, etc, were of course all procedurally created within Blender</p>
