            </div>

            <p>hi! i'm Jacob, i'm a graphics, programming, and graphics programming lover, currently studying games programming at Staffordshire University.</p>
            <br>

            <div style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden">
                <div class="container" style="width: 457px; float: left;">
                    <p>my primary interest in rendering and graphics really crystallised in my gap year, where i took a drawing foundation course and developed my art skills in the 3D software Blender and 2D Inkscape, as well as my game development skills.</p>
                    <p>since then i've become fascinated by 3D and 2D graphics, the mathematics and algorithms that drive them, and the technical side of digital art and videogames.</p>
                    <p>my particular interest is in stylised visuals, post-processing (and image processing broadly) and novel rendering techniques.</p>
                </div>

            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <p>i have experience in various programming languages including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C/C++</li>
                    <li>GLSL</li>
                    <li>Assembly</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>python</li>
                </ul>
                <p>i've self-taught myself programming since almost age 10, and i've picked up various skills for best practice, debugging, and optimisation along the way. i'm also good at developing large-scale architecture for projects, and following processes of decomposing large problems so they can be solved more easily.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <p>having studied further maths at A level, i have a solid understanding of linear algebra, integration and differentiation, complex numbers, and statistical methods, all often important for digital graphics.</p>
                <p>however, more than that, my attitude to problem solving allows me to put those tools to use in order to create unique shader effects, develop geometric solutions to spatial problems, build procedural/algorithmic generation systems, and more.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">the amazing team i was part of for developing <i>Disc-Go!</i>, one of the 1UP Scheme games.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="container">
                        <p>my investigative attitude to learning and problem solving allows me to pick up and understand complex problems or pre-existing systems relatively easily, and gives me the ability to produce novel solutions and ideas.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="container" style="width: 274px; float: right; height: 416px;">
                    <p>i'm also a good teamworker: i communicate ideas effectively, and foster a friendly work environment. in fact, the drawing course i took has given me some extremely useful tools both for visualising my own ideas and presenting them diagramatically or graphically to others.</p>
                    <p>i have experience working on shared projects, i'm familiar with source control and collaboration, and organisation and division of work both verbally and using kanban boards.</p>
                    <p>for instance, i was recently part of the Staffs <a href="projects/1up-scheme.html">1UP Scheme</a>, an internship program run by Staffs as a standalone studio attached to the university, where i collaborated with a mid-sized team to produce an excellent party game, <i>Disc-Go!</i>, an experience which i have absolutely loved.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p>currently, i'm working on a few projects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>building this portfolio in HTML and CSS (and learning both of these along the way)</li>
                    <li>creating a Google-earth-style explorer application in C++, and teaching myself the Vulkan API in the process</li>
                    <li>working on a simple FBX debug tool, capable of reading, displaying their internal structure, editing, and saving FBX object files</li>
                    <li>by far my biggest project, building a from-scratch operating system kernel in C++ and Assembly, with the intention of developing it into an integrated videogame, with a retro-futurist space exploration theme</li>
                    <li>a series of space-themed poster-style artworks combining digital 2D and 3D, along with a lot of procedural elements (post processing, texturing, geometry). see <a href="projects/new-stacks.html">this</a> project</li>
                </ul>
                <p>some would say i have too many projects going at once. sometimes i find time to play videogames too...</p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <p>as you might have guessed, i'm a lover of space, but also of surrealism, cassette-futurism, brutalism, fungi, botany, and bonsai.</p>
            <p>my favourite book is <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i> by Shirley Jackson (or perhaps <i>The Ultimate Alphabet</i> by Mike Wilks); my current book is <i>House of Leaves</i> by Mark Z Danielewski.</p>
