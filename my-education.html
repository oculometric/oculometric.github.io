        <p>i'm currently studying Computer Games Programming at Staffordshire University.</p>
        <p>i've finished my first and second years with top grades across all modules so far. i'm now working on my dissertation, looking at isosurface extraction, specifically using marching tetrahedra.</p>

            Gap Year

        <p>after my A levels, at the last minute i decided to take a gap year to explore my art interests. i spent the year practising with digital 3D media (specifically <span style="color: var(--carmine)">Blender</span>), particularly developing my interest in rendering and shading.</p>
        <br>
        <p>i also took a <span style="color: var(--carmine)">Foundation Drawing</span> course with the <a href="https://www.oca.ac.uk" target="_blank">OCA</a>, which greatly improved my ability to visualise and express ideas, as well as being extremely useful for general artistic principles of proportion, presentation, tone, etc which i continue to <span style="color: var(--carmine)">draw</span> on.</p>
        <p>this bit of self-exploration made me realise i wanted to pursue subjects which intersect art and programming, so late into my gap year i decided to reapply to university, cancelling my originally accepted offer for Computer Science and AI at Bath and applying instead for games design and programming courses.</p>

            2020 - 2022
        </span>
        <p>at A level i studied: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-U Maths</li>
            <li>Pre-U Further Maths</li>
            <li>Computer Science</li>
            <li>Psychology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>i received distinctions in both mathematics subjects, an A* in computer science and an A in psychology.</p>
        <p>additionally, i studied History of Art as an AS level, which helped develop my interest in art despite not being able to study art directly at A level. i really enjoyed getting to do a mixture of creative work in my preferred field, and analytical/historical work.</p>
