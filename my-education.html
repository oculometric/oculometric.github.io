                <h2>Staffordshire University</h2>
                <p>i'm currently studying Computer Games Programming at Staffordshire University.</p>
                <p>i've finished my first year with top grades across all modules so far.</p>

                <h2>Gap Year (2022-2023)</h2>
                <p>after my A levels, at the last minute i decided to take a gap year to explore my art interests. i spent the year practising with digital 3D media (specifically <b>Blender</b>), developing my interest in rendering and shading.</p>
                <p>i also took a <b>Foundation Drawing course with the <a href="https://www.oca.ac.uk" target="_blank">OCA</a></b>, which greatly improved my ability to visualise and express ideas, as well as being extremely useful for general artistic principles of proportion, presentation, tone, etc which i continue to <i>draw</i> on.</p>
                <p>this bit of self-exploration made me realise i wanted to pursue subjects which intersect art and programming, so late into my gap year i decided to reapply to university, cancelling my originally accepted offer for Computer Science and AI at Bath and applying instead for games design and programming courses.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>A Levels (2020-2022)</h2>
                <p>at A level i studied: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pre-U Maths</li>
                    <li>Pre-U Further Maths</li>
                    <li>Computer Science</li>
                    <li>Psychology</li>
                </ul>
                <p>i received distinctions in both mathematics subjects, an A* in computer science and an A in psychology.</p>
                <p>additionally, i studied History of Art as an AS level, which helped develop my interest in art despite not being able to study art directly at A level.</p>

                <h2>GCSEs (2018-2020)</h2>

                <p>the last of which i taught myself (being already familiar with programming and various technical concepts), without formal tuition. i achieved top grades across all of the above.</p>
