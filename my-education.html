                <h2>Gap Year (2022-2023)</h2>
                <p>after my A levels, at the last minute i decided to take a gap year to explore my art interests. i spent the year practising with digital 3D media (specifically <b>Blender</b>), developing my interest in rendering and shading.</p>
                <p>i also took a <b>Foundation Drawing course with the OCA</b>, which greatly improved my ability to visualise and express ideas, as well as being extremely useful for general artistic principles of proportion, presentation, tone, etc which i continue to draw on.</p>
                <p>late into my gap year i decided to reapply to university, cancelling my originally accepted offer for Computer Science and AI at Bath and applying instead for games design and programming courses.</p>
